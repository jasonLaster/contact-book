// Assuming this is a file naming convention example.  No actual code was provided.

// Original filename: myFile_[id].txt
// Updated filename: myFile_[urlName].txt

// Example usage in a hypothetical file creation function:

function createFile(urlName) {
  const fileName = `myFile_[urlName].txt`
  // ... rest of file creation logic ...
}
